## Batch deposit Huff

### Requirements

The following will need to be installed in order to use this repo.

-   [Foundry / Foundryup](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry)
-   [Huff Compiler](https://docs.huff.sh/get-started/installing/)

## Quickstart

```
forge install
forge test
```

To run the benchmark script :
```
FORK_URL=$ETH_RPC_URL make benchmark
```

## Usage
Only the arguments encoding matter, the signature is not checked.
If you wish to deploy the contract, on a testnet you have to change the hard-coded deposit contract address in the contract.

### HuffClassic interface :
``` 
anySignature(bytes pubkeys, bytes withdrawal_creds, bytes signatures, bytes32[] deposit_data_roots)
```
`pubkeys` : concatenation of the public keys of the validators
`withdrawal_creds` : concatenation of the withdrawal credentials of the validators
`signatures` : concatenation of the signatures of the validators
`deposit_data_roots` : concatenation of the deposit data roots of the validators

### HuffCompact interface :
```
any_signature(bytes data) 
```
`data` : concatenation of the concatenations of the pubkey, withdrawal_cred, signature and deposit_data_root of each validator

## Benchmark
Ran against a fork at block `18255674`
